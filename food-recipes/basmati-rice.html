    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Place rice into a bowl with enough water to cover. Set aside to soak for
        20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the last 10 minutes of soaking, heat oil in a large pot or saucepan
        over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves, then
        stir in cumin seed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir until fragrant and toasted, about a minute. Add sliced
        onion and stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauté until the onion is tender and a rich golden brown color, about 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain water from rice, and stir into the pot. Cook and stir rice until
        lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add water and salt, and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low.
        Simmer until all the water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Let stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork before serving.</li>
